Claire Kuzak



\## Project Overview

This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to compare the Columbus, Ohio and New York City markets. The goal is to determine whether Columbus or NYC has better options for investors by determining which areas and/or neighborhoods are more tourist-based and the average price points, versus the areas/neighborhoods that have more locals.



\## Research Questions

1. Are there more long-term listings versus short-term listings?

2\. Which area has more bookings in peak season?

3\. Which neighborhood has the most amount of listings in each area?

4\. Which area has more commonly attended events?

5\. What is the average price point for each location?
